LCSK (LiveChat Starter Kit)
=============================

LCSK is a simple, lightweight live support ASP.NET C# app. It uses SignalR for the communication channel 
between the website visitor and the operator(s).

I just moved the project over GitHub, it was previoulsy hosted on [CodePlex](http://livechatstarterkit.codeplex.com).
